# Maternal-health-risk-after-delivery

**Project Summary**

**Objective and Motivation**
The primary goal was to predict the risk level (High, Mid, or Low) of women after delivery to help healthcare providers prioritize timely medical interventions and improve outcomes.

**Dataset and Features**

The project used a clinical dataset of 1,014 instances.

The models were trained on physiological features including Age, Systolic & Diastolic Blood Pressure (BP), Blood Sugar (BS), Body Temperature, and Heart Rate.

**Models and Results:**

The team evaluated two supervised machine learning models: Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

The Random Forest model was found to be superior, delivering the highest predictive accuracy.

Using a cross-validation approach with an 80/20 train-test split, the Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 84.65%.

**Key Findings**
The analysis indicated that features such as blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic), age, and heart rate have a substantial impact on determining the maternal risk category.


**Conclusion and Implications** 
The study reinforces the potential of machine learning to assist doctors in clinical decision support systems by providing early risk warnings and supporting timely medical decisions. Limitations noted include the moderate dataset size and the presence of class imbalance.
